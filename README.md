# 📊 Interactive Rational Number Explorer

An interactive educational tool built with **Streamlit** to visualize rational numbers between two user-defined fractions. This project helps students and educators explore the density and distribution of rational numbers on a number line.

## 🔍 Features

- Input custom bounds using fractions (`a`, `b`)
- Choose maximum denominator to control granularity
- Dynamically generate all rational numbers between `a` and `b`
- Visualize them neatly on a number line with fraction labels
- Simple and intuitive UI with clean plots

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand what rational numbers are
- Discover how many rationals exist between two numbers
- Explore how increasing denominators adds more fractions
- See rational spacing visually to grasp concepts of density

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit** — for interactive web UI
- **Matplotlib** — to generate dynamic plots
- **Fractions module** — for precise rational calculations

## ▶️ Getting Started
